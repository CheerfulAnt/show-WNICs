# show-WNICs

Bash script that shows information about active WNICs.

Script that shows information about active WNICs (network interface name, driver, type of bus, chipset). I know thereâ€™s a better way to obtain this same informations by lsusb, lspci or wifite:). But this one, in some cases, is more convenient for me.
